## Technical Architecture

### Memory Layer Architecture
```
┌─────────────────┐
│  Ephemeral      │ ← 4K tokens, session retention
│  (Short-term)   │
├─────────────────┤
│  Session        │ ← 64K tokens, 24-hour retention
│  (Medium-term)  │
├─────────────────┤
│  Persistent     │ ← 1M+ tokens, indefinite retention
│  (Long-term)    │
└─────────────────┘
```

### Doctrine Preservation Flow
```
Doctrine Update → Validation → Storage → Compliance Check → Audit Trail
