## 🎯 PHASE 1: MACBOOK SETUP & LAUNCH

### System Detection & Setup Selection

**Automatic System Detection:**
```bash
# Check your MacBook specifications
echo "RAM: $(echo "scale=1; $(sysctl -n hw.memsize) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024" | bc)GB"
echo "Chip: $(sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string)"
echo "macOS: $(sw_vers -productVersion)"
```

**Setup Selection:**
- **8GB M1 MacBook:** Use `macbook_8gb_m1_setup.sh` (Ultra-conservative mode)
- **16GB+ MacBook:** Use `macbook_16gb_setup.sh` (Full operations mode)

## 💪 PHASE 2: WINDOWS HEAVY COMPUTATION

**Compatible with both MacBook variants:**
- **8GB M1 MacBook:** Windows handles ALL heavy computation and services
- **16GB+ MacBook:** Windows provides additional heavy computation capacity

### Step 2.1: Windows Setup
```powershell
# On Windows machine, navigate to Super Agency
cd C:\path\to\Super-Agency
```

### Step 2.2: Sync with MacBook (Auto-Detection)
```powershell
# Auto-detect Mac IP and start services
.\sync_to_windows.ps1 -StartServices
```

**For 8GB M1 MacBooks:**
- Windows becomes the primary computation hub
- All agent deployment, AAC system, and heavy processing runs here
- Mac provides ultra-lightweight mobile interface only

**For 16GB+ MacBooks:**
- Windows provides additional heavy computation capacity
- Mac can run some local services with Windows backup

**Expected Output (both variants):**
```
🔄 Super Agency Distributed Setup (SASP v1.0)

## 🔧 PHASE 5: TROUBLESHOOTING & VERIFICATION

### Issue 1: Mac Services Won't Start
```bash
# Check ports
lsof -i :8080,5000,3000

# Kill existing processes
pkill -f python

# Restart
./macbook_launch.sh
```

### Issue 2: Windows Can't Connect to Mac
```powershell
# Manual IP entry
.\sync_to_windows.ps1 -MacIP 192.168.1.100 -StartServices

# Test connection
Test-NetConnection 192.168.1.100 -Port 8080
```

### Issue 3: Mobile Interface Not Loading
- **Check firewall:** Ensure ports 8080, 5000, 3000 open
- **Verify IP:** Use correct Mac IP address
- **Test locally:** http://localhost:8080 on MacBook

### Issue 4: Memory Usage Too High
```bash
# Check memory on Mac
top -l 1 | grep PhysMem

# Restart lightweight
pkill -f python
./macbook_launch.sh
```

### Issue 5: Agents Not Responding
```bash
# Check agent logs
tail -f logs/council.log

# Restart agents
python3 inner_council/deploy_agents.py --mode restart
```

---

## 📈 PHASE 6: PERFORMANCE VERIFICATION

### Memory Usage Check
```bash
# MacBook memory
echo "Mac Memory: $(echo "scale=1; $(ps aux | awk 'BEGIN {sum=0} {sum += $6} END {print sum/1024/1024}')MB" | bc)GB used"
```

### Service Status Check
```powershell
# Windows status
.\sync_to_windows.ps1 -Status
```

### Mobile Performance Test
- **Load time:** < 2 seconds
- **Memory usage:** < 4GB total on Mac
- **Command response:** < 5 seconds
- **Status updates:** Real-time

## 📊 PHASE 7: SCALE-UP PLANNING

### Immediate Upgrades (Next Month)
- **MacBook RAM:** Upgrade to 32GB ($200-400)
- **Expected improvement:** 6-10 agents, faster response

### Medium-term (3-6 Months)
- **Mac Studio 128GB:** $4,199
- **Expected capacity:** 25-40 agents, enterprise operations

### Long-term (6-12 Months)
- **Mac Pro:** $7,499+ with 768GB RAM
- **Multiple Windows machines**
- **AWS integration** for overflow

### Cost-Benefit Analysis
```
Current Setup: $0 (existing hardware)
32GB Upgrade: $300 → 2.5x capacity increase
Mac Studio: $4,199 → 10x capacity, 5-year ROI
```
