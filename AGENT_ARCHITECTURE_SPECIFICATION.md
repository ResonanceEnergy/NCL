## 5. ADVANCED AGENT SERVICES

### 5.1 Agent Marketplace
**Definition:** Dynamic discovery and loading service for council agents.

**Capabilities:**
- Scan `inner_council/agents` directory at runtime for new agent modules
- Import and register arbitrary agent classes without modifying codebase
- Provide API for listing available agent types and instantiation
- Enables hot-plug extendibility and third-party agent deployment

**Usage:**
- `from agents.agent_marketplace import global_marketplace`
- `global_marketplace.list_available_agents()` returns current agent classes
- `global_marketplace.create_agent("SomeAgent")` instantiates a new agent

### 5.2 Swarm Intelligence
**Definition:** Ephemeral grouping mechanism that assembles specialized agent teams to address discrete tasks.

**Capabilities:**
- `SwarmCoordinator` service creates and tracks swarm instances
- Each swarm member is an isolated agent loaded via the marketplace
- Supports result aggregation, lifecycle management, and termination
- Useful for parallel analysis, simulation, or crisis problem solving

**API:**
- `swarm_id = swarm_coordinator.initiate_swarm(task, ["AgentA", "AgentB"])`
- `swarm_coordinator.collect_results(swarm_id)`
- `swarm_coordinator.terminate_swarm(swarm_id)`

### 5.3 Meta-Agent Coordination
**Definition:** A high-level meta-agent that oversees marketplace operations, swarms, and cross-agent orchestration.

**Capabilities:**
- Acts as a super-agent with messaging handlers specific to meta-operations
- Can list available agents, spawn/terminate swarms, and query swarm status
- Receives and responds to meta-level commands via the message bus
- Provides a centralized command interface for administrator-level control

**Agent:** `MetaCoordinator`
- Automatically registered by the agent registry
- Implements message handlers such as `meta_list_agents`, `meta_initiate_swarm`, etc.
